 write-good-py

 Inspired by Brian Ford



 This is designed as a naive linter for the English Language, using specific modules.

 This program is also developed in literal form, where the program is it's own documentation.

 (Inspired by CoffeeScript Literal programs.)

<p>Development Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No Tabs used, 4 Spaces Instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies should be as few as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike the original write-good, developing this project as a single script file, ala Bottle.py, is preferable.</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows it to be a drop-in file, to get up and running inside any other project out there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When commenting code, the comment goes above the line that is being commented about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try and use a Markdown flavour of code, though beginning each line with a '#' symbol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flags should only be utilised for functions that are optional to the core function. (If in doubt, go to <a href="https://github.com/shakna-israel/write-good-py">Issues</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

 Versioning Notes:



 This project was developed under Python 2.7 originally, though support for Python 3.x is incoming.

 But as of this commit, it remains untested.

 Debugging tools

```global verbose```

```verbose = False```

<p>Print a helpful statement about arguments.</p>

<pre><code>
 Grab a file from the commandline argument, and store it into memory:

```def get_file():```

   # Fetch the global verbose setting, to allow for complex debugging

```global verbose```

   # Check if any commandline arguments are issued to the linter.

```try:```

       # Expect the user to supply the filename as the first argument.

       # This lets the developer integrate write-good-py into all sorts of scripting environments, and doesn't put the weight of interfacing at this end.

       # Also means that we don't need a dozen flags. Flags are for optional things.

```if sys.argv[1]:```

```FILENAME = sys.argv[1]```

```else:```

```if verbose:```

```print sys.argv[1]```

       # Check if the argument the user has given is actually a file.

```if os.path.isfile(FILENAME):```

           # Attempt to open the file, if it fails, throw an exception.

```try:```

```file = open(FILENAME,&quot;r&quot;)```

               # For each line in the file, let's run the annotate function.

```for line in file.read().split('\n'):```

```annotate(file)```

               # Close the file to remove any locks.

```file.close()```

```except:```

```raise Exception, &quot;File could not be opened. Do you have permissions?&quot;```

```except Exception as exception:```

```print &quot;Exception: %s&quot; % exception```

```else:```

           # If the user has given an argument that is not a file, raise an exception for that.

```try:```

```raise Exception, &quot;File either does not exist, is not a file, or you do not have permissions to the file.&quot;```

```except Exception as exception:```

```print &quot;Exception: %s&quot; % exception```

```help()```

   # If no arguments are found, then run a function for that.

```except IndexError as exception:```

```if verbose:```

```print &quot;Exception: %s&quot; % exception```

```help()```

   # If any other exceptions come up, send them to the verbose system, rather than crashing on them.

```except:```

```if verbose:```

```print &quot;Except: %s&quot; % exception```

```help()```

<p>This is not the final function. This program will have a main function, and that will be the final function to handle everything and which way to take things. It's just for testing.</p>
