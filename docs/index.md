This is a Python Implementation of [Brian Ford's write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good), a naive linter for the English language.

This implementation is currently under heavy development and *not reccomended for use*, development or otherwise.

# Why?

I love [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good), and I use it often for both prose and documentation.

In automating some documentation building, I wanted to incoroporate some automated checks, using write-good, however, as the documentation engine was Python, I wanted something of the same flavour to make everything simpler.

# Documentation

Automatically generated from the write-good.py file, Documentation is available [here](https://shakna-israel.github.io/write-good-py/).
